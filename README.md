This repo contains the first lab of the third Coursera NLP course in both, source Tensorflow code and problematic PyTorch code

Why problematic? - Because the PyTorch Adam optimizer performed much poorer than TensorFlow Adam optimizere with the same hyperparameters. 

This repo also contains the testing file with the same initialized starting weights.
